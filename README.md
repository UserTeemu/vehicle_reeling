# Vehicle Reeling
A tiny Minecraft mod that adds client-side functionality for reeling vehicles ridden by players with fishing rods.
Vanilla servers already support this.

# Compatibility
This mod consists of only one Mixin file, so it should be relatively compatible with other mods and other Minecraft versions. However, if a fishing rod overhaul was to come, this would mod would probably break.

This mod was developed for Minecraft 1.20.1 but currently, it has been set to accept all Minecraft versions. Compatibility has not been tested.

If any issues arise, feel free to open an issue on GitHub.
